# Lab 2 

## Feedback from Dr. Theobold 

"Careful! A professional looking report should not display messages about reading in the data or loading in package. These messages are not useful for the reader and make your document look cluttered."

"Technically, both geom_point() and geom_jitter() are plotting points, so you are actually double plotting the points. You only need one of these geoms in your plot!"

"You do not need to use the coord_flip() function to flip the coordinates of your plot. There is a much simpler way. Can you find it?"

## My Revision Reflections 

One of my takeaways from the feedback I received on this lab was the importance of suppressing unnecessary messages/outputs. When I first turned this in, I did not know that the output that prints in the console when I run my code will be printed in the quarto document automatically unless I specify otherwise. Now I know to use the "messages: false" or "echo: false" functions in the code chunks to prevent this. I also did not understand that using geom_point and geom_jitter at the same time is redundant because they are plotting the same data. I changed my plot in question 6 to only include geom_jitter so that we could see the points more clearly. Finally, I learned that the coord_flip function is not necessary to use if we want to change the orientation of box plots because we can just switch the x and y in the code and get the same result. I think I previously used coord_flip because I had learned about it in the reading and assumed that it was the best option since I would just have to copy the previous code and add coord_flip to the end.
