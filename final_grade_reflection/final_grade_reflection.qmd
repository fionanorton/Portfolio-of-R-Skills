# Final Grade Reflection

## Accomplishment of Learning Targets

Based on my understanding of the material, my contribution to the classroom and to my team, and my improvement in personal goals throughout the course, I believe I deserve an A in this class. Over these ten weeks I have strengthened my knowledge of R and R Studio with each preview activity, practice activity, lab assignment, and challenge problem and I have shown proficiency in the majority of the learning targets. 

WD-1 can be seen in the "setup" of Lab 3 and Lab 8. WD-2, WD-3, and WD-4 are demonstrated in Lab 3 questions 7, 10, and 6 (respectively). My proficiency in WD-5 and WD-6 can be seen in Lab 4 question 2. WD-7 can be seen in Lab 4 question 7 and Lab 9 question 1. 

DVS-1, DVS-2, and DVS-3 are shown in Lab 2 question 12, Lab 4 questions 5 and 6, and Lab 7 question 2. DVS-4, DVS-5, and DVS-6 can be seen in Challenge 3 question 3 and Lab 9 question 1. DVS-7 is shown in Challenge 9 questions 10 and 11.

One example of how I have shown R-1 is in the first code chunk ("The Data") of Lab 7. R-2 can be seen in Lab 7 questions 2 and  7. I show R-3 in Lab 4 question 3 and Lab 7 question 7. 

PE-1 is shown in Lab 4 question 3 and Lab 8 question 1. PE-2 and PE-3 can be seen in Lab 8 question 4. PE-4 is shown in Lab 5 question 8.

DSM-1 can be seen in Practice Avticity 9.2. DSM-2 is shown in Lab 9 questions 4 and 5. 

## Evidence of Continued Learning

### Extending My Thinking

I have extended my thinking in this course through the completion of challenge problems as evidenced by the challenges I have chosen to include in my portfolio (Challenge 3, 7, 8 and 9). Here, I dive deeper into specific aspects of the corresponding labs to further my understanding of the material. For example, in Challenge 9, I used the kable function from the kableExtra package to create nicer looking html tables in questions 1, 2, 10 and 11. 

### Revising My Thinking 

Throughout this course when given the opportunity to make revisions to my code, I have almost always taken advantage of that and attempted to improve my code and my understanding of R. This can be seen in the Revision Reflections document located in the revisions folder under Continued Learning in my portfolio. Making revisions and reflecting on what I have learned from my revisions has changed the way I code. This is best shown by the feedback and revision reflections from Labs 2, 4 and 7; all of these labs provided me with feedback that I now consider every time I code. Specifically in Lab 7 I was told to consider how I could reduce the redundancy in a specific function I wrote and since then I have worked hard to make sure that when writing any function, it is as efficient as possible and does repeat anything within the function.


## Growth as a Team Member

### Collaborative Group Work 

The collaborative group work in this course has made me a better team member. It has improved my ability to ask questions and explain my thinking. Each week a leader emerged from our team, someone who felt confident in their ability to complete the task at hand. The other three group members would then fall into other roles. My team is supportive and driven; together we have been able to successfully complete every practice activity and contribute to a positive classroom environment.

### Peer Code Review 

I have completed each assigned peer code review carefully and with thought. I provide specific feedback about code and try to tell my peers exactly where I think they could make improvements. This process is helpful for them but also for me because I have improved my ability to read and understand code. A good example of my peer code review is from Week 4 which can be seen in my Growth as a Team Member folder.

## Attention to Personal Goals 

I have made major progress in accomplishing my personal goals for the quarter. I am able to create easy to read, helpful, and relevant data visualizations and tables. I have a much better understanding of quarto documents, R projects, and GitHub. Overall I feel much more prepared to code in R than I did at the beginning of the quarter because I can do it more efficiently with the new skills I have learned in this class.
